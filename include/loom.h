/// \brief Specifies a task that is permitted to run by another task.
///
/// \details Permits are a simplified implementation of reverse dependencies,
/// as described by Charles Bloom in his blog posts.
///
/// By using permits the following is achieved:
///
///  (1) Simpler code. Scheduling and permitting code is substantially smaller
///      and simpler than normal dependencies.
///
///  (2) Guaranteed scheduling without overhead. By maintaining references to
///      any non-queued tasks in a "permit" any submitted tasks are
///      guaranteed to be scheduled without an additional data-structure.
///      Either by being inserted into a woker's queue immediately, or by being
///      inserted later upon the completion of the final permitting task.
///
///  (3) Improved scheduling characteristics. Permits adhere to Charles Bloom's
///      guiding principles:
///
///        1. Always yield worker threads when they cannot schedule work.
///        2. Never have a worker thread sleep when it can schedule work.
///        3. Never wake a worker thread only to yield it immediately.
///
///  (4) Reduced memory footprint. Normal dependencies require more memory
///      due to additional members in task descriptions and the use of empty
///      parent tasks to collect dependencies for tasks with more than `n`
///      dependencies.
